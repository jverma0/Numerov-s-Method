# Schrödinger Equation for a Simple Harmonic Oscillator

This repository contains a basic code for solving the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator using the Numerov's method.

The repository was created mainly to learn how GitHub works, including creating a repository and uploading code. The code itself was written for practice and learning purposes.

To solve schrodinger's equation using Numerov's method

testing github.
